# Classification of species using K-means model

## Introduction

K-means clustering is very effective when segmenting data and attempting to find patterns. For this reason clustering is used in a broad array of industries.

In this project, we've got data for a scientific organization that works to support and sustain penguin colonies. We been tasked with helping other staff members learn more about penguins in order to achieve this mission.

The data for this activity is in a spreadsheet that includes datapoints across a sample size of 345 penguins, such as species, island, and sex. Your will use a K-means clustering model to group this data and identify patterns that provide important insights about penguins.

As this data is obtained from a real industry, we'll need to perform data cleaning and EDA before we fit it in a model.

The dataset has been made available in csv format as well
